        <h3 className='threat-text threat-header'>The Threat</h3>
        <p className='threat-text threat-paragraph'> Risk in overseas markets often evolves gradually, even insidiously, sometime surfacing as subtle developments or hidden dynamics in a foreign country or market that go unnoticed until they suddenly become business and market disruptive. Risk is even more of a threat in emerging markets that appear commercially promising but remain heavily influenced by deeply rooted cultures and values that can negatively impact the business environment. Cyber risk is especially prevalent and knows no borders. Understanding if and why a business might be a target is the first step in risk mitigation. The extensive knowledge and experience of Q Advisors is a valuable tool in managing domestic and overseas risk as well as risk in the cyber domain. </p>
        <p className='threat-text'><u>The Q Advantage</u></p>
        <p className='threat-text threat-paragraph'> Q Advisors have extensive overseas experience and knowledge from conducting and leading clandestine operations in every region of the world. Q Advisors also have the experience and expertise that comes with managing security risk for corporations exposed to international, domestic, internal and cyber risk. Q Advisors understand particularly well the risk set faced by high net worth individuals and their families. In this respect, the partners have taken their extensive overseas experience and knowledge, developed over decades of sensitive work for the U.S. government and the private sector and effectively applied to managing client risk. </p>
        <p className='threat-text threat-paragraph'> The skills that once benefited Presidents and their senior advisors, from the collection of unique intelligence to deep analysis, have now proven equally valuable to the CEOâ€™s, Chief Risk Officers, and portfolio managers that represent Q Advisors client set. In the process, each member of our small group has become conversant in what matters most to decision makers in the private sector, helping to identify and address developing issues and solve problems in the same proactive manner as they did in government. </p>
