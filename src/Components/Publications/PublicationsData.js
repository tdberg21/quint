    paragraphs: ['Since retiring from their top posts at marquee entities, Rob Dannenberg and John O\'Connor have been guiding high net worth families in the area of risk and security. Both spent years protecting and advising some of the most influential entrepreneurs in the United States on a wide - range of risk topics. In this chapter of their careers, they’re sharing expertise with families who want to better understand current threats and more importantly, practical strategies to mitigate risk.', 'While Rob and John held top security spots for years at Goldman & Fidelity, respectively, the foundation of their careers is actually quite different, contributing to their unique perspective -- and ultimately, the value shared with clients.  Rob came from the CIA and had a distinguished career spanning the globe, including senior posts in countries that dominate today’s news. His views on geopolitical risk are influenced by decades of experience from a vantage point few have (or can imagine). John came to Fidelity from Deloitte, where he was a Partner and leader of their forensic accounting practice in Boston.  John’s experience at Fidelity included ultimate responsibility for investigating all fraud attempts across Fidelity’s customer platform (60+ million accounts) for over a decade. This is experience few have in today’s challenge of cybercrime and online fraud schemes.', 'While both can write on a variety of topics, their recent experience with many executives and family offices were a catalyst for this document.  They see common gaps and misconceptions in how high net worth clients view risk for themselves and their families. This article is simply a starting point to frame some of those areas and perhaps generate some additional thought on how best to gain comfort.', 'Many executives to whom we speak consider themselves “below the radar” and worry more about their kids in this area than themselves.  While it’s common to have younger generations exposing more personal information on the internet, you may not be as stealthy as you think.  Economic criminals tend to have very strong research capabilities and whether it’s philanthropic activity, executive biographies or regulatory filings, there is often a treasure trove of information available – over and above what is scraped from social network activity for the family.  Why is this important? Personal data is the easiest path for a criminal to customize an email used to infect your system with malware (known as phishing). While the email may appear benign, coming from the local golf club or charity you love, the malware attached is used to steal your ID and password at financial institutions. Knowing what’s out there about you and having good online hygiene can help you avoid many headaches.', 'With daily news related to Russia and China, it’s easy to conclude the adversary for brokerage account fraud is one of these nation-states.  Contrary to that view, most individual financial fraud cases are not performed at the nation-state level.  In reality, the adversaries are sophisticated economic criminals, who may operate in Russia or Eastern Europe, but are skilled entrepreneurs in the highly profitable business of identity theft and exfiltration of financial assets.  With all the rhetoric and scare tactics circulating, it’s common for individuals to be confused on what to do, or to whom to turn for help. There are, in fact, some fundamental things you can do to protect yourself and your family. Some are technical but many are not. To start, you need to make it difficult for criminals to impersonate you while logging into financial accounts. Traditional passwords, no matter their length, are of limited value and quite easy to steal for experienced criminals. Second, making it more difficult to pull cash out is also important.  Some of this is a function of your financial institution but some is within your control. For example, most people think of “freezing credit” as simply preventing a criminal from opening a new credit card in your name. Actually, the primary benefit of a freeze is the prevention of criminals opening new bank or investment accounts in your name – these often serve as outbound channels for the criminal to transfer funds abroad. By the time you know there’s a new account, it’s often after the money is gone.', 'In today’s risk environment—especially in the cyber domain—nation-state adversaries of the United States or the West, incapable of responding militarily or economically to actions taken by the United States (such as sanctions) are increasingly using cyber as a means to retaliate.  Cyber offers the advantages of relatively precise targeting and difficulty of attribution. As examples in recent years have shown, the target set selected by nation state adversaries is not random but carefully selected to “send a message” or cause pain and embarrassment to prominent individuals or entities (and thus strike the U.S.) yet the attacks fall short of the type of disruption that would force a kinetic response from the United States. Two examples are North Korea’s targeting of Sony Pictures and Entertainment for the production of a film perceived to be critical of Kim Jong-Un and Iran’s targeting of Las Vegas Sands Casinos when the Founder and Chairman Sheldon Adelson made off the record remarks in a speech at Yeshiva University critical of the Iranian regime. While these were high profile state-sponsored acts of the use of cyber for political retaliation, there have been many unpublished lower-profile examples of nation-states trolling the internet looking for comments or political activity by high profile or net worth individuals perceived by these regimes to be hostile. Often these retaliatory nation-state actions are masqueraded as activities by common cyber criminals. In this environment it is prudent to be regularly aware of your profile in the surface, gray, and deep web environments.  Are your donations or “off-the-record” or are they available on the web ready to be added to the matrix of targets by hostile nation-state?  Useful to know.', 'The December 1, 2017 detention of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver by Canadian authorities acting on a request by the United States, may have been more consequential than many realize.  China protested the detention immediately and described it as a hostile political act. China then responded by detaining two Canadian citizens, including a former diplomat, and charging them with crimes against national security. Moreover, the Chinese used the appeal process of the trial of a Canadian citizen charged with drug trafficking for which he had received a 15-year prison term to change the sentence to the death. While this is an extreme example, Russia has similarly recently detained a U.S. citizen seemingly to be held hostage for actions the U.S. has taken against Russian citizens Maria Butina and Victor Bout, the former with presumed connections to Russian intelligence and the latter with known connections to Russian oligarchs close to Russian President Putin. While these incidents might indicate risk with travel to Russia and China, the risk may well extend to contiguous countries and regions where Russian and Chinese intelligence and security services have capabilities and influence. After all, Meng was detained in Canada at the request of the U.S.  You might wonder if states like Russia or China would want to incur the risk and negative publicity that would come with the detention of a wealthy or prominent American.  We would remind readers that Meng Wanzhou is a very wealthy and prominent Chinese female business executive. She is the daughter of Huawei’s founder, Vice Chair of China’s largest private company, and is arguably the Chinese equivalent of Sheryl Sandberg.  So it may be risky to assume the Chinese wouldn’t take action against an equivalent U.S. citizen especially if Meng is extradited. There are steps that you, your employees and family can take to reduce the risks of being caught up in a geopolitical tug-of-war, but those steps may not be either intuitive or convenient. They are, however, worth knowing and observing.', 'Obviously, the topics above are a small fraction of what these men convey to their new clientele.  All aspects of security and risk are on the table when they meet with clients and it’s typical that executives or family offices want to know how they’re doing in certain areas or what they haven’t thought about? Whether the concern is cybercrime, geopolitical risk or the valley of issues in between, it’s unusual to have direct access to professionals with credentials such as Rob and John.  Just as important, these men have spent their careers operating with great discretion and understand the importance of trust in the family office environment.  If you have a need in the risk or security area, contact information is provided for each in the contact section.']

    paragraphs: ['“There is no limit to a human being’s ability to rationalize the truth” —One of the Moscow Rules', 'The Moscow Rules, by Antonio and Jonna Mendez is a gripping, interesting and relevant read. It is gripping because it reads like a spy novel yet tells a true tale of the darkest days of the espionage war largely fought between the CIA and the KGB and its successor organ the FSB. It is interesting because it describes both on - the - street action and the largely unknown behind - the - scenes creativity, dedication and diligence of technical and operations experts in the Agency, from Hollywood, and from the world of magic and illusion. The book is relevant because it reminds us of the continuing need for human intelligence to understand the intentions and capabilities of a resurgent Russia led by a former officer in the KGB. The book is written by two experts and national heroes whose contribution to U.S.intelligence successes in this critical period is unquestioned. They tell the whole story: The good, the bad, and the ugly episodes of this epic espionage struggle.', 'First referred to by George Smiley, a fictional character in the espionage thrillers of John LeCarre , ‘The Moscow Rules’ refer to tenets of operational practice for denied area and specifically operations in the former Soviet Union that were developed over time and are still adhered to today. As noted in the book, “Moscow has always been an ominous destination for an intelligence officer. From the days of Catherine the Great through the rule of Vladimir Putin, no other espionage environment has rivaled it.”', 'The book tells in some detail, the story of three critical human sources and the role their experiences played in the evolution of Moscow tradecraft and the principles behind the successful application of that tradecraft referred to in the book’s title.', 'The first case study is that of Oleg Penkovsky, a colonel in Soviet military intelligence (GRU) dubbed “The Spy Who Saved the World” for the intelligence he provided that helped then- President John F. Kennedy navigate the Cuban Missile Crisis. The CIA’s lack of preparation for handling agents in Moscow at this time because of the pervasive nature of surveillance in that operational environment, contributed to Penkovsky’s compromise and forced the Agency to re- examine its approach to operations in Moscow.', 'The second case is that of Alexandr Ogorodnik, code name TRIGON, an incredibly valuable Soviet Foreign Ministry penetration who provided insights on Soviet policy, foreign relations and arms control negotiation strategies. But the TRIGON case is also a story of bravery, intrepidness and creativity by the case officers and techs who were responsible for handling the source in Moscow. Foremost among these was Marti Peterson, the case officer (C/O) ambushed and PNG’ed from Moscow after the case was compromised. The first true “deep cover” office in Moscow and the station’s first female C/O, Marti was a true trailblazer. Her passionate recollection of the TRIGON operation told to me when I was a young career trainee, was instrumental in my decision to spend the bulk of my career in Russian operations.', 'The final HUMINT case study is that of Adolf Tolkachev, the “Billion Dollar Spy”, that is again, a story of risk taking and the incredible teamwork of case and technical operations officers to succeed in denied area operations. Although each of these cases have been described in more detail elsewhere, what the authors add is the detail of collaboration between techs and C/O’s that are the secret sauce for making these operations work.', 'Of particular interest, is the outreach by the authors during their careers, to the magician and illusionist talent in Hollywood and elsewhere, some of this described in a previous book by the authors which subsequently became the hit movie, Argo.', 'Disguise, misdirection, sleight-of-hand concealment devices—keys to the trade of the illusionist—became keys to the success of Moscow Station operations and are discussed in fascinating detail in this book.', 'Shortly after the time period of the cases described in the book, I had the honor of attending a dinner in Washington with the CIA Director, Deputy Director and their Russian Foreign Intelligence counterparts in a private room at a discreet restaurant in Washington. The CIA Deputy Director at the time, John McLaughlin, is an accomplished magician. He performed a couple of illusions at the dinner, causing the Director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service to shake his head and lament that he now knew why the Soviet Union had lost the Cold War.', 'This book is particularly timely and relevant given the re-emergence of the Russian threat as manifested most visibly in the Russian intelligence effort to undermine confidence in our political system. There seems to be no shortage of former members of the U.S. Intelligence Community and pundits of the Fourth Estate who consider themselves competent to comment on Russian intelligence operations and strategy, almost all of whom have little or no experience in Russian operations. This would be – for them – a useful read. Russia, and particularly the generation of KGB officers represented in Russia’s leadership cadre today, starting with President Vladimir Putin, have our destruction as their objective. As the authors note, “They were always our preeminent adversaries, and while the Soviet Union has become Russia, that has not changed to this day. They knew us then and know us today as the Main Enemy.”', 'The Moscow Rules earns a prestigious four out of four trench coats.', 'The Reviewer, Rob Dannenberg, is a 24-year veteran of the CIA, where he served in several senior leadership positions, including chief of the Central Eurasia Division. He was responsible for running Moscow operations from both Headquarters and the field. He is now an independent consultant and speaker on geopolitical and security risk, after serving as the managing director and head of the Office of Global Security for Goldman Sachs.', 'Editor’s Note: One of the authors, Antonio Mendez, passed away earlier this year at the age of 78. Read more about his adventurous life and contributions to the CIA in this New York Times piece.']

    paragraphs: ['Presidents and generals depend upon timely intelligence to shape their decisions in a world of ambiguity, hostile actors and disinformation. The savviest leaders in the private sector do the same.', 'Governments have broad intelligence authorities and powerful tools unavailable to the public sector, but they do not have a monopoly on the application of intelligence methodology and tradecraft. Your company can and should use systematic and legal intelligence collection and analysis to manage risk, identify opportunity and make better decisions.', 'What threats do I face? What are my rivals doing? Just who is this potential partner? When do I evacuate? Who is behind this cyberattack? Should I enter this market? The questions that intelligence can inform are limited only by the array of problems a chief executive officer confronts.', 'All CEOs have access to vast quantities of information, but relatively few demand actual intelligence: the systematic collection and analysis of information in response to specific requirements.', 'Without intelligence, companies are needlessly blind to looming threats, constantly surprised by foreseeable change, and wastefully failing to recognize opportunity that others seize. Why this gap? Failure to embrace intelligence in the private sector can be explained by three misconceptions of what intelligence is, and what it is not.', 'Intelligence is not information: Information, by itself, is just data. Intelligence provides context, separating wheat from data chaff through a systematic process of collection, analysis and application to a decision.', 'Intelligence is not espionage. Intelligence is often wrongly confused with spying. A professional private-sector intelligence program does not steal industrial secrets, wiretap competitors or surveil opponents. Rather, it operates within strict guidelines of governance, compliance and legality to enhance your ability to avoid the financial, legal and reputational problems which come with being blind to what is happening around you. Indeed, under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), companies have a positive obligation to conduct due diligence to understand just what they are getting into.', 'Intelligence is not costly. Governments spend billions on vast intelligence bureaucracies and sophisticated technical tools, but a private company doesn’t need to. Rather, a modest investment of corporate resources can generate enormous advantage. Raw intelligence is freely and widely available, often right at your fingertips. Just as nations use human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), companies can use networks, social media and satellite imagery to effectively and inexpensively answer strategic and tactical questions. A right-sized intelligence capability provides great return on investment in terms of money saved, risk reduced and opportunity identified.', 'An in-house corporate intelligence team may consist of a single analyst, or may be a large, multi-disciplinary unit. Many firms depend upon intelligence vendors, which deliver subscription-based products, produce custom reports, and conduct in-depth investigations.', 'Some vendors will embed analysts in the client firm, other have developed a “fractional analyst” model, which enables a firm to simply book analyst time. Either model can produce significant advantages of time, insight, and context, but there are pitfalls in outsourcing your intelligence requirements and relying upon vendors for you most sensitive and important work. A hybrid model of a lean in-house corporate team which draws upon external resources and capability as needed can maximize flexibility and cost efficiency.', 'The need for corporate intelligence shops is feeding a growing academic field, leavened by Labor Department statistics showing a rising demand for trained and seasoned intelligence analysts. A number of universities have built degree programs, including Mercyhurst University, which has undergraduate and graduate programs to prepare analysts for roles in the private sector and government.', 'Building your own station:', 'Should you want to build your own intelligence capability, or to improve on what you already have, where should you start? The first step is to view intelligence as a distinct corporate discipline and follow a few key principles:', 'Embrace the Intelligence Cycle. The “Intelligence Cycle” is the basic framework used in the intelligence community to describe the methodology which transforms information and data into intelligence which shapes better decisions. If you do nothing else, basic application of the Intelligence Cycle will help you better refine your intelligence needs, gaps and resources. The elements are simple, but each requires discipline and tradecraft.', 'Requirements: Determining the question to be answered and the decision to be made is the first and most important part of the intelligence cycle. Time spent here greatly improves chances of a successful intelligence outcome.', 'Collection: Collection produces “raw intelligence,” that is to say, information collected with your requirements in mind. What data do you already have, what more do you need and where can you find it? The quality of the data, the reliability of the sources, and the variety of inputs are all important factors to consider. Intelligence failure can often be attributed to over-reliance on a single source or to failure to understand source bias.', 'Analysis: Analysis evaluates the raw intelligence you’ve collected in context of your requirements to produce “finished intelligence.” It is the process that transforms mere information into the intelligence, which can best inform your decisions. Good analysis screens out bias and tests assumptions. It compares disparate sources to corroborate and correlate the raw intelligence and, on occasion, to contradict prevailing views.', 'Dissemination: Getting the finished intelligence to the right decision maker at the right time is critical. This is easier said than done.', 'Feedback: The intelligence cycle is complete when the consumer provides feedback on intelligence received, poses follow up questions, and generates new requirements. Inevitably, any decision taken on basis of intelligence received will in turn generate new questions and requirements. Done well, feedback fosters an iterative, and virtuous, circle.', 'Using intelligence:', 'Be an active consumer. I recently spoke with a business leader who had achieved a major success in recovering millions of dollars stolen by a partner in a foreign jurisdiction. He engaged a private intelligence firm to develop intelligence on the theft and locate the funds. The intelligence enabled an influence campaign and supported a legal process, which ultimately led to recovery of the funds.', 'The key takeaway for the executive was that the best intelligence goes to the best clients. He enabled success by working intimately with the intelligence team to shape and iterate requirements, to make decisions, and then track the impact of those decisions through the Intelligence Cycle.', 'Beware of your own bias. During the Korean War, General Douglas MacArthur was convinced that the Chinese would not cross the Yalu River to engage United Nations forces advancing northwards. Despite mounting intelligence that Chinese “volunteers” had already entered Korea and, regardless of clear Chinese statements of intent to intervene, MacArthur clung to his belief until his troops were being driven southwards by the Chinese Peoples Volunteer Army.', 'MacArthur fell victim to a form of “confirmation bias,” seizing upon intelligence which confirmed his world view and rejecting that which didn’t. Intelligence which contradicts one’s views is the easiest to reject, but the most important to consider. In business, where there is built-in need to be optimistic about deals and partners, intelligence provides a critical check and balance.', 'Understanding the Intelligence Industry:', 'An ecosystem of intelligence firms has grown to support corporate needs. Some are founded by former intelligence professionals; others have evolved out of investigative firms, media conglomerates, or “big box” consultancies. Each brings advantage and disadvantage; there is no one size fits all. To evaluate and choose, ask your potential intelligence partner a few key questions:', 'Where are you strong? Whether on an issue or geography, if an intelligence firm claims that they are good at everything, then walk away. Even the CIA and MI6 have coverage gaps; no firm can offer universally strong intelligence coverage across the array of locations and problems your firm faces.', 'What are your sources? You want to understand how and where the firm collects its raw intelligence. They probably won’t tell you source names, but they should be able to describe the types of positions, nature of their relationships, and reporting track records. You should be confident that the access matches requirements.', 'Who are your analysts? Many firms rely on ranks of young graduates to staff their analytic boiler rooms. While smart and sometimes well trained, they may also be inexperienced and have no direct understanding of the geography or issues on which they write. Find out who is writing the analysis, what experience they have, and what languages are covered. Determine as well whether you will have direct access to them.', 'Do you subcontract? A number of larger firms simply act as intelligence general contractors, subcontracting your requirements to other local firms, generally not transparent to you. This may result in higher cost and higher risks.', 'What are your standards? You should get clear answers to this question which reflects your ethical values and compliance culture. Beware of cowboys, winks and nods, and suggestions that there is a shortcut. You don’t have a get out of jail free card.', 'Bottom line:', 'Intelligence is there for you, not just for three-letter agencies. It provides advantage in your decision-making, sometimes small, sometimes large. It provides threat warning, but also enables you to conduct business in tough environments and geographies where context is everything. Intelligence taps into the skills, reach and networks of your workforce.', 'In short, smart application of basic intelligence principles can enable your organization, however small or large, to understand and adapt to a complex world of dynamically evolving threat and constantly evolving opportunity.']
