        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            Russia’s willingness to detain a U.S. citizen in apparent retaliation for the recent case against Russian citizen Marina Butina, should serve as a warning to U.S. citizens who are traveling – without the benefit of diplomatic immunity –  of the risks in traveling to countries where the rule of law is dictated by geopolitical considerations. It’s a risk which current business and personal travelers should be aware of and one that is not likely to go away in the near term.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            While there is never a completely “safe” time to travel to countries like Russia or China, the examples of Whelan, Canadian citizens Michael Spevor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig, both detained in recent weeks by Chinese authorities “on suspicion of endangering national security” should serve as a warning of just how real the risk can be.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            The detention of the Canadians is presumed to be in retaliation for the arrest of Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on December 1, 2018.  Meng was detained by the Canadians for extradition at the request of U.S. authorities. She is a prominent Chinese businesswoman, a senior executive at Huawei, a technology firm already under heavy U.S.-led pressure for suspected collection activity for Chinese intelligence.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            No one should be surprised at China’s rapid retaliatory detention of the Canadians. The timing of Whelan’s detention is certainly not coincidental either and needs to be considered within the context of geopolitical risk in U.S.-Russian relations. At the moment, geopolitical considerations are paramount.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            While no one would argue that Marina Butina is a figure of any consequence beyond her media notoriety, (she is certainly not the equivalent in stature of Meng), in the context of the free fall of U.S.-Russian relations and the abundance of headlines on the malfeasance and missteps of Russian intelligence operatives in recent months, it was only a matter of time before Putin ordered retaliatory measures for her detention.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            Putin, a former intelligence officer, is likely a historian of the genre and knows there is a long history of non-combatants being caught up in spy games. Moreover, he is probably still stinging from the embarrassment of the June 2010 arrest of ten Russian “illegals” in the U.S. and their subsequent ‘spy swap’ for Russians who were arrested under charges of cooperation with western intelligence services.  (One of the illegals was Anna Chapman whose publicity following her arrest has led to a successful career in television and modeling in Russia).  This is not to make light of Whelan’s detention, which is quite serious, nor should we think that Putin is not capable of being disproportionately ruthless in these circumstances. Take for example, the case of the Ukrainian sailors detained in the Russian aggression in the Sea of Azov which resulted in President Trump cancelling his meeting with Putin at the recent G-20 summit in Buenos Aires.  Twenty-one of the twenty-four detained Ukrainian sailors have been transferred to Moscow’s notorious Lefortova Prison. The three wounded sailors are now incarcerated at the hospital wing of the equally notorious Matrosskaya Tishina prison.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            Whelan will likely not face such a fate, at least not in the near term, with sustained media attention.  Though as Congress considers legislation to impose additional sanctions on Russia for the Russian Military Intelligence (GRU) nerve agent attack against former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the UK last year, as well as for meddling in the U.S. mid-term elections, and perhaps even as a reaction to the Mueller investigation (if that leads to allegations of collusion in the near term) the Whelan case could quickly turn into a high-stakes game. Depending on events, don’t be surprised if another U.S. citizen is detained. Putin will have plenty of support for such escalation in the hardline community upon whose support he relies, and the Russian general public who are inundated with state-controlled media propaganda of western conspiracies against Russia.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            In light of the risks highlighted by these recent detentions, what should western business travelers think about if they have planned business or personal travel to countries where the rule of law is trumped by geopolitics?
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            First, consider deferring travel until the geopolitical atmosphere improves.  Second, take steps to minimize your risk by carefully considering what technical equipment you take along with you. What may be considered benign in the West might not be viewed the same way in a hostile environment.  For example, does your computer or smartphone contain information which could be considered incriminating by a hostile regime?  In the case of Russia or China, saved news articles that are critical of the regime and are stored on your computer, or posts from “anti-regime” websites, could be incriminating.  Travelers should also consider email correspondence that they would not want to see in the possession of a hostile prosecutor, all of which could be considered ‘evidence’ of hostile intent. Encrypted correspondence, similarly so.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            Is the purpose of your travel clearly articulated and documented? Is it affiliated with well-known institutions with a long record of travel to your destination?  Has an effort been made to register travel with the appropriate U.S. embassy or consulate?   While on the ground, are you prepared to undertake appropriate precautions to make sure you don’t violate any local laws, engage in illegal currency transactions or participate in the unauthorized purchase of articles of historical or cultural value? These can be common traps for business travelers.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            Taking an unregistered GPS-capable device near a sensitive government facility can be considered an act of espionage in some countries. The location of those facilities may not always be apparent.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            Geopolitical issues are a serious factor in international business travel. The days when carrying a U.S. or western passport or being engaged in a developmental business or NGO that provided some form of protection are long gone.  Be the prudent traveler who is aware of the risks and take appropriate actions.

        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Presidents and generals depend upon timely intelligence to shape their decisions in a world of ambiguity, hostile actors and disinformation. The savviest leaders in the private sector do the same.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Governments have broad intelligence authorities and powerful tools unavailable to the public sector, but they do not have a monopoly on the application of intelligence methodology and tradecraft. Your company can and should use systematic and legal intelligence collection and analysis to manage risk, identify opportunity and make better decisions.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          What threats do I face? What are my rivals doing? Just who is this potential partner? When do I evacuate? Who is behind this cyberattack? Should I enter this market? The questions that intelligence can inform are limited only by the array of problems a chief executive officer confronts.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          All CEOs have access to vast quantities of information, but relatively few demand actual intelligence: the systematic collection and analysis of information in response to specific requirements.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Without intelligence, companies are needlessly blind to looming threats, constantly surprised by foreseeable change, and wastefully failing to recognize opportunity that others seize. Why this gap? Failure to embrace intelligence in the private sector can be explained by three misconceptions of what intelligence is, and what it is not.
        </p>
        <ol >
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><i>Intelligence is not information:</i> Information, by itself, is just data. Intelligence provides context, separating wheat from data chaff through a systematic process of collection, analysis and application to a decision.</li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><i>Intelligence is not espionage.</i> Intelligence is often wrongly confused with spying. A professional private-sector intelligence program does not steal industrial secrets, wiretap competitors or surveil opponents. Rather, it operates within strict guidelines of governance, compliance and legality to enhance your ability to avoid the financial, legal and reputational problems which come with being blind to what is happening around you. Indeed, under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), companies have a positive obligation to conduct due diligence to understand just what they are getting into.</li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><i>Intelligence is not costly.</i> Governments spend billions on vast intelligence bureaucracies and sophisticated technical tools, but a private company doesn’t need to. Rather, a modest investment of corporate resources can generate enormous advantage. Raw intelligence is freely and widely available, often right at your fingertips. Just as nations use human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), companies can use networks, social media and satellite imagery to effectively and inexpensively answer strategic and tactical questions. A right-sized intelligence capability provides great return on investment in terms of money saved, risk reduced and opportunity identified.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          An in-house corporate intelligence team may consist of a single analyst, or may be a large, multi-disciplinary unit. Many firms depend upon intelligence vendors, which deliver subscription-based products, produce custom reports, and conduct in-depth investigations.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Some vendors will embed analysts in the client firm, other have developed a “fractional analyst” model, which enables a firm to simply book analyst time. Either model can produce significant advantages of time, insight, and context, but there are pitfalls in outsourcing your intelligence requirements and relying upon vendors for you most sensitive and important work. A hybrid model of a lean in-house corporate team which draws upon external resources and capability as needed can maximize flexibility and cost efficiency.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          The need for corporate intelligence shops is feeding a growing academic field, leavened by Labor Department statistics showing a rising demand for trained and seasoned intelligence analysts. A number of universities have built degree programs, including Mercyhurst University, which has undergraduate and graduate programs to prepare analysts for roles in the private sector and government.

          <b>Building your own station</b>
          <br></br>
          Should you want to build your own intelligence capability, or to improve on what you already have, where should you start? The first step is to view intelligence as a distinct corporate discipline and follow a few key principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u>Embrace the Intelligence Cycle.</u> The “Intelligence Cycle” is the basic framework used in the intelligence community to describe the methodology which transforms information and data into intelligence which shapes better decisions. If you do nothing else, basic application of the Intelligence Cycle will help you better refine your intelligence needs, gaps and resources. The elements are simple, but each requires discipline and tradecraft.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u>Requirements:</u> Determining the question to be answered and the decision to be made is the first and most important part of the intelligence cycle. Time spent here greatly improves chances of a successful intelligence outcome.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u>Collection:</u> Collection produces “raw intelligence,” that is to say, information collected with your requirements in mind. What data do you already have, what more do you need and where can you find it? The quality of the data, the reliability of the sources, and the variety of inputs are all important factors to consider. Intelligence failure can often be attributed to over-reliance on a single source or to failure to understand source bias.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u>Analysis:</u> Analysis evaluates the raw intelligence you’ve collected in context of your requirements to produce “finished intelligence.” It is the process that transforms mere information into the intelligence, which can best inform your decisions. Good analysis screens out bias and tests assumptions. It compares disparate sources to corroborate and correlate the raw intelligence and, on occasion, to contradict prevailing views.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u>Dissemination:</u> Getting the finished intelligence to the right decision maker at the right time is critical. This is easier said than done.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u>Feedback:</u> The intelligence cycle is complete when the consumer provides feedback on intelligence received, poses follow up questions, and generates new requirements. Inevitably, any decision taken on basis of intelligence received will in turn generate new questions and requirements. Done well, feedback fosters an iterative, and virtuous, circle.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b>Using intelligence</b>
          <br></br>
          <i>Be an active consumer.</i> I recently spoke with a business leader who had achieved a major success in recovering millions of dollars stolen by a partner in a foreign jurisdiction. He engaged a private intelligence firm to develop intelligence on the theft and locate the funds. The intelligence enabled an influence campaign and supported a legal process, which ultimately led to recovery of the funds.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          The key takeaway for the executive was that the best intelligence goes to the best clients. He enabled success by working intimately with the intelligence team to shape and iterate requirements, to make decisions, and then track the impact of those decisions through the Intelligence Cycle.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <i>Beware of your own bias.</i> During the Korean War, General Douglas MacArthur was convinced that the Chinese would not cross the Yalu River to engage United Nations forces advancing northwards. Despite mounting intelligence that Chinese “volunteers” had already entered Korea and, regardless of clear Chinese statements of intent to intervene, MacArthur clung to his belief until his troops were being driven southwards by the Chinese Peoples Volunteer Army.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          MacArthur fell victim to a form of “confirmation bias,” seizing upon intelligence which confirmed his world view and rejecting that which didn’t. Intelligence which contradicts one’s views is the easiest to reject, but the most important to consider. In business, where there is built-in need to be optimistic about deals and partners, intelligence provides a critical check and balance.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b>Understanding the Intelligence Industry</b>
          <br></br>
          An ecosystem of intelligence firms has grown to support corporate needs. Some are founded by former intelligence professionals; others have evolved out of investigative firms, media conglomerates, or “big box” consultancies. Each brings advantage and disadvantage; there is no one size fits all. To evaluate and choose, ask your potential intelligence partner a few key questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u>Where are you strong?</u> Whether on an issue or geography, if an intelligence firm claims that they are good at everything, then walk away. Even the CIA and MI6 have coverage gaps; no firm can offer universally strong intelligence coverage across the array of locations and problems your firm faces.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u>What are your sources?</u> You want to understand how and where the firm collects its raw intelligence. They probably won’t tell you source names, but they should be able to describe the types of positions, nature of their relationships, and reporting track records. You should be confident that the access matches requirements.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u>Who are your analysts?</u> Many firms rely on ranks of young graduates to staff their analytic boiler rooms. While smart and sometimes well trained, they may also be inexperienced and have no direct understanding of the geography or issues on which they write. Find out who is writing the analysis, what experience they have, and what languages are covered. Determine as well whether you will have direct access to them.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u>Do you subcontract?</u> A number of larger firms simply act as intelligence general contractors, subcontracting your requirements to other local firms, generally not transparent to you. This may result in higher cost and higher risks.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u>What are your standards?</u> You should get clear answers to this question which reflects your ethical values and compliance culture. Beware of cowboys, winks and nods, and suggestions that there is a shortcut. You don’t have a get out of jail free card.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b>Bottom line</b>
          <br></br>
          Intelligence is there for you, not just for three-letter agencies. It provides advantage in your decision-making, sometimes small, sometimes large. It provides threat warning, but also enables you to conduct business in tough environments and geographies where context is everything. Intelligence taps into the skills, reach and networks of your workforce.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          In short, smart application of basic intelligence principles can enable your organization, however small or large, to understand and adapt to a complex world of dynamically evolving threat and constantly evolving opportunity.
