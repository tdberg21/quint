        <h4 className='article-text'>Critical Areas for Family Office Leadership
        </h4>
        <h6 className='article-text article-subheader'><i>from the former Chief Security Officers of Goldman Sachs and Fidelity Investments</i>
        </h6>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Since retiring from their top posts at marquee entities, Rob Dannenberg and John O'Connor have been guiding high net worth families in the area of risk and security. Both spent years protecting and advising some of the most influential entrepreneurs in the United States on a wide-range of risk topics.  In this chapter of their careers, they’re sharing expertise with families who want to better understand current threats and more importantly, practical strategies to mitigate risk.
          </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          While Rob and John held top security spots for years at Goldman & Fidelity, respectively, the foundation of their careers is actually quite different, contributing to their unique perspective -- and ultimately, the value shared with clients.  Rob came from the CIA and had a distinguished career spanning the globe, including senior posts in countries that dominate today’s news. His views on geopolitical risk are influenced by decades of experience from a vantage point few have (or can imagine). John came to Fidelity from Deloitte, where he was a Partner and leader of their forensic accounting practice in Boston.  John’s experience at Fidelity included ultimate responsibility for investigating all fraud attempts across Fidelity’s customer platform (60+ million accounts) for over a decade. This is experience few have in today’s challenge of cybercrime and online fraud schemes.
          </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          While both can write on a variety of topics, their recent experience with many executives and family offices were a catalyst for this document.  They see common gaps and misconceptions in how high net worth clients view risk for themselves and their families. This article is simply a starting point to frame some of those areas and perhaps generate some additional thought on how best to gain comfort.
          </p>
        <b className='article-paragraphs'>Digital Footprint for You and Your Family</b>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Many executives to whom we speak consider themselves “below the radar” and worry more about their kids in this area than themselves.  While it’s common to have younger generations exposing more personal information on the internet, you may not be as stealthy as you think.  Economic criminals tend to have very strong research capabilities and whether it’s philanthropic activity, executive biographies or regulatory filings, there is often a treasure trove of information available – over and above what is scraped from social network activity for the family.  Why is this important? Personal data is the easiest path for a criminal to customize an email used to infect your system with malware (known as phishing). While the email may appear benign, coming from the local golf club or charity you love, the malware attached is used to steal your ID and password at financial institutions. Knowing what’s out there about you and having good online hygiene can help you avoid many headaches.
          </p>
        <b className='article-paragraphs'>Who’s the Enemy When it Comes to Online Fraud in Financial Accounts?</b>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          With daily news related to Russia and China, it’s easy to conclude the adversary for brokerage account fraud is one of these nation-states.  Contrary to that view, most individual financial fraud cases are not performed at the nation-state level.  In reality, the adversaries are sophisticated economic criminals, who may operate in Russia or Eastern Europe, but are skilled entrepreneurs in the highly profitable business of identity theft and exfiltration of financial assets.  With all the rhetoric and scare tactics circulating, it’s common for individuals to be confused on what to do, or to whom to turn for help. There are, in fact, some fundamental things you can do to protect yourself and your family. Some are technical but many are not. To start, you need to make it difficult for criminals to impersonate you while logging into financial accounts. Traditional passwords, no matter their length, are of limited value and quite easy to steal for experienced criminals. Second, making it more difficult to pull cash out is also important.  Some of this is a function of your financial institution but some is within your control. For example, most people think of “freezing credit” as simply preventing a criminal from opening a new credit card in your name. Actually, the primary benefit of a freeze is the prevention of criminals opening new bank or investment accounts in your name – these often serve as outbound channels for the criminal to transfer funds abroad. By the time you know there’s a new account, it’s often after the money is gone.
          </p>
        <b className='article-paragraphs'>Geopolitical Risk Might Be More Personal Than You Think</b>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          In today’s risk environment—especially in the cyber domain—nation-state adversaries of the United States or the West, incapable of responding militarily or economically to actions taken by the United States (such as sanctions) are increasingly using cyber as a means to retaliate.  Cyber offers the advantages of relatively precise targeting and difficulty of attribution. As examples in recent years have shown, the target set selected by nation state adversaries is not random but carefully selected to “send a message” or cause pain and embarrassment to prominent individuals or entities (and thus strike the U.S.) yet the attacks fall short of the type of disruption that would force a kinetic response from the United States. Two examples are North Korea’s targeting of Sony Pictures and Entertainment for the production of a film perceived to be critical of Kim Jong-Un and Iran’s targeting of Las Vegas Sands Casinos when the Founder and Chairman Sheldon Adelson made off the record remarks in a speech at Yeshiva University critical of the Iranian regime. While these were high profile state-sponsored acts of the use of cyber for political retaliation, there have been many unpublished lower-profile examples of nation-states trolling the internet looking for comments or political activity by high profile or net worth individuals perceived by these regimes to be hostile. Often these retaliatory nation-state actions are masqueraded as activities by common cyber criminals. In this environment it is prudent to be regularly aware of your profile in the surface, gray, and deep web environments.  Are your donations or “off-the-record” or are they available on the web ready to be added to the matrix of targets by hostile nation-state?  Useful to know.

        <b className='article-paragraphs'>There May Be More Risk in Travel Than Flight Delays</b>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          The December 1, 2017 detention of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver by Canadian authorities acting on a request by the United States, may have been more consequential than many realize.  China protested the detention immediately and described it as a hostile political act. China then responded by detaining two Canadian citizens, including a former diplomat, and charging them with crimes against national security. Moreover, the Chinese used the appeal process of the trial of a Canadian citizen charged with drug trafficking for which he had received a 15-year prison term to change the sentence to the death. While this is an extreme example, Russia has similarly recently detained a U.S. citizen seemingly to be held hostage for actions the U.S. has taken against Russian citizens Maria Butina and Victor Bout, the former with presumed connections to Russian intelligence and the latter with known connections to Russian oligarchs close to Russian President Putin. While these incidents might indicate risk with travel to Russia and China, the risk may well extend to contiguous countries and regions where Russian and Chinese intelligence and security services have capabilities and influence. After all, Meng was detained in Canada at the request of the U.S.  You might wonder if states like Russia or China would want to incur the risk and negative publicity that would come with the detention of a wealthy or prominent American.  We would remind readers that Meng Wanzhou is a very wealthy and prominent Chinese female business executive. She is the daughter of Huawei’s founder, Vice Chair of China’s largest private company, and is arguably the Chinese equivalent of Sheryl Sandberg.  So it may be risky to assume the Chinese wouldn’t take action against an equivalent U.S. citizen especially if Meng is extradited. There are steps that you, your employees and family can take to reduce the risks of being caught up in a geopolitical tug-of-war, but those steps may not be either intuitive or convenient. They are, however, worth knowing and observing.
          </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Obviously, the topics above are a small fraction of what these men convey to their new clientele.  All aspects of security and risk are on the table when they meet with clients and it’s typical that executives or family offices want to know how they’re doing in certain areas or what they haven’t thought about? Whether the concern is cybercrime, geopolitical risk or the valley of issues in between, it’s unusual to have direct access to professionals with credentials such as Rob and John.  Just as important, these men have spent their careers operating with great discretion and understand the importance of trust in the family office environment.  If you have a need in the risk or security area, contact information is provided for each in the contact section.

          <i className='article-paragraphs'>Tuesday’s meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov covered a wide range of issues, including arms control, the situation in Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, Syria, to name a few.</i>

          <i className='article-paragraphs'>The Cipher Brief reached out to expert, Robert Dannenberg, a 24-year veteran of the CIA and former head of the Office of Global Security for Goldman Sachs, as well as former director of International Security Affairs for BP to get his take.</i>

          Did the U.S. gain anything from Tuesday’s meeting between Pompeo and Lavrov?
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b className='article-paragraphs'>Dannenberg: </b>
          That remains to be seen.  At the outset, it seems like dialogue for the sake of dialogue.  Many have speculated President Trump feels the vindication of the Mueller report has created an opening to reset relations with Russia.  This wouldn’t be the first “reset” in recent times and I am skeptical this reset will have a different result than the previous efforts.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b className='article-paragraphs'>The Cipher Brief: </b>
          Is Russia an important partner for the U.S. on the issues that were on the agenda, to include arms control, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, Syria and a few other issues?
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b className='article-paragraphs'>Dannenberg: </b>
          Like it or not, none of the problems on the agenda can be solved without Russia.  They may not be able to be solved even if we engage with Russia.  But they would likely become a lot worse without engaging with Russia.  Russia views engagement with the US on problems beyond the Central Eurasian region as a validation of Russia’s return to “super power” or world power status.  This is a key element in Putin’s world view and overall strategy.  He states it often.  To wit, the unipolar US/NATO-led world has failed to preserve world and strategic stability.  Putin believes a bi-polar or multi-polar world model more closely replicates what he views as the “stability” of the bi-polar Cold War model.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b className='article-paragraphs'>The Cipher Brief: </b>
          Pompeo said he communicated to the Russians that there were tangible steps Russia could take to demonstrate that they will not interfere with U.S. elections.  Based on Russia’s pattern of hybrid warfare that has included election interference, is it reasonable to assume that Russia will heed a warning, or respond to a call not to interfere?
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b className='article-paragraphs'>Dannenberg: </b>
          No reasonable observer has any doubt Russia has used its massive cyber and intelligence capabilities for the past decade to engage in a comprehensive effort to influence elections and disrupt the social and political order of its geopolitical opponents.  I think Russia’s use of this tool, most pointedly in disrupting the US social and political order since 2016 and before, will go down as the most cost effective “active measure”—the Russian term for covert action—in history.  If you look at the body of evidence of Russia’s effort right now to influence the result of the European Parliament elections you need to recognize Putin is not in any way dissuaded by the punitive measures thus far used.  Nor is he likely to be dissuaded, by his calculus he has achieved exactly what he set out to achieve.  The economic disruption caused by US and western sanctions is merely an inconvenience in Putin’s eyes.  It is well and good that Pompeo delivered a strong message.  I fear it is unlikely to have any effect.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b className='article-paragraphs'>The Cipher Brief: </b>
          Both sides agreed to ‘rebuild channels of communication’.  Do you see any specific opportunities that the U.S. could gain from that?
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b className='article-paragraphs'>Dannenberg: </b>
          Communication is better than lack of communication, almost always.  When the risk of conflict by mistake or miscalculation is as acute as it is at the moment (think Iran, Venezuela, or the Korean Peninsula, for example), as a first step, rebuilding military-to-military and intel-to-intel communication channels, many suspended since 2014 seems sensible to me.  If we handle those channels effectively, we will reduce risk and maybe learn something in the process.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Russia is a bit like six degrees of Kevin Bacon.  There isn’t a geopolitical risk in the world that it would take anything near six steps to get to Russia.  Those who suggest ignoring or isolating Russia without a comprehensive strategy for dealing with Putinism just don’t get it.  We need a 21st Century George Kennan to help develop that strategy.

        </h6>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Presidents and generals depend upon timely intelligence to shape their decisions in a world of ambiguity, hostile actors and disinformation. The savviest leaders in the private sector do the same.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Governments have broad intelligence authorities and powerful tools unavailable to the public sector, but they do not have a monopoly on the application of intelligence methodology and tradecraft. Your company can and should use systematic and legal intelligence collection and analysis to manage risk, identify opportunity and make better decisions.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          What threats do I face? What are my rivals doing? Just who is this potential partner? When do I evacuate? Who is behind this cyberattack? Should I enter this market? The questions that intelligence can inform are limited only by the array of problems a chief executive officer confronts.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          All CEOs have access to vast quantities of information, but relatively few demand actual intelligence: the systematic collection and analysis of information in response to specific requirements.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Without intelligence, companies are needlessly blind to looming threats, constantly surprised by foreseeable change, and wastefully failing to recognize opportunity that others seize. Why this gap? Failure to embrace intelligence in the private sector can be explained by three misconceptions of what intelligence is, and what it is not.
        </p>
        <ol >
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><i className='article-paragraphs'>Intelligence is not information:</i>  Information, by itself, is just data. Intelligence provides context, separating wheat from data chaff through a systematic process of collection, analysis and application to a decision.</li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><i className='article-paragraphs'>Intelligence is not espionage.</i> Intelligence is often wrongly confused with spying. A professional private-sector intelligence program does not steal industrial secrets, wiretap competitors or surveil opponents. Rather, it operates within strict guidelines of governance, compliance and legality to enhance your ability to avoid the financial, legal and reputational problems which come with being blind to what is happening around you. Indeed, under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), companies have a positive obligation to conduct due diligence to understand just what they are getting into.</li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><i className='article-paragraphs'>Intelligence is not costly.</i> Governments spend billions on vast intelligence bureaucracies and sophisticated technical tools, but a private company doesn’t need to. Rather, a modest investment of corporate resources can generate enormous advantage. Raw intelligence is freely and widely available, often right at your fingertips. Just as nations use human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), companies can use networks, social media and satellite imagery to effectively and inexpensively answer strategic and tactical questions. A right-sized intelligence capability provides great return on investment in terms of money saved, risk reduced and opportunity identified.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          An in-house corporate intelligence team may consist of a single analyst, or may be a large, multi-disciplinary unit. Many firms depend upon intelligence vendors, which deliver subscription-based products, produce custom reports, and conduct in-depth investigations.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          Some vendors will embed analysts in the client firm, other have developed a “fractional analyst” model, which enables a firm to simply book analyst time. Either model can produce significant advantages of time, insight, and context, but there are pitfalls in outsourcing your intelligence requirements and relying upon vendors for you most sensitive and important work. A hybrid model of a lean in-house corporate team which draws upon external resources and capability as needed can maximize flexibility and cost efficiency.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          The need for corporate intelligence shops is feeding a growing academic field, leavened by Labor Department statistics showing a rising demand for trained and seasoned intelligence analysts. A number of universities have built degree programs, including Mercyhurst University, which has undergraduate and graduate programs to prepare analysts for roles in the private sector and government.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b className='article-paragraphs'>Building your own station</b>
          <br></br>
          Should you want to build your own intelligence capability, or to improve on what you already have, where should you start? The first step is to view intelligence as a distinct corporate discipline and follow a few key principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u className='article-paragraphs'>Embrace the Intelligence Cycle.</u> The “Intelligence Cycle” is the basic framework used in the intelligence community to describe the methodology which transforms information and data into intelligence which shapes better decisions. If you do nothing else, basic application of the Intelligence Cycle will help you better refine your intelligence needs, gaps and resources. The elements are simple, but each requires discipline and tradecraft.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u className='article-paragraphs'>Requirements:</u> Determining the question to be answered and the decision to be made is the first and most important part of the intelligence cycle. Time spent here greatly improves chances of a successful intelligence outcome.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u className='article-paragraphs'>Collection:</u> Collection produces “raw intelligence,” that is to say, information collected with your requirements in mind. What data do you already have, what more do you need and where can you find it? The quality of the data, the reliability of the sources, and the variety of inputs are all important factors to consider. Intelligence failure can often be attributed to over-reliance on a single source or to failure to understand source bias.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u className='article-paragraphs'>Analysis:</u> Analysis evaluates the raw intelligence you’ve collected in context of your requirements to produce “finished intelligence.” It is the process that transforms mere information into the intelligence, which can best inform your decisions. Good analysis screens out bias and tests assumptions. It compares disparate sources to corroborate and correlate the raw intelligence and, on occasion, to contradict prevailing views.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u className='article-paragraphs'>Dissemination:</u> Getting the finished intelligence to the right decision maker at the right time is critical. This is easier said than done.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u className='article-paragraphs'>Feedback:</u> The intelligence cycle is complete when the consumer provides feedback on intelligence received, poses follow up questions, and generates new requirements. Inevitably, any decision taken on basis of intelligence received will in turn generate new questions and requirements. Done well, feedback fosters an iterative, and virtuous, circle.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b className='article-paragraphs'>Using intelligence</b>
          <br></br>
          <i className='article-paragraphs'>Be an active consumer.</i> I recently spoke with a business leader who had achieved a major success in recovering millions of dollars stolen by a partner in a foreign jurisdiction. He engaged a private intelligence firm to develop intelligence on the theft and locate the funds. The intelligence enabled an influence campaign and supported a legal process, which ultimately led to recovery of the funds.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          The key takeaway for the executive was that the best intelligence goes to the best clients. He enabled success by working intimately with the intelligence team to shape and iterate requirements, to make decisions, and then track the impact of those decisions through the Intelligence Cycle.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <i className='article-paragraphs'>Beware of your own bias.</i> During the Korean War, General Douglas MacArthur was convinced that the Chinese would not cross the Yalu River to engage United Nations forces advancing northwards. Despite mounting intelligence that Chinese “volunteers” had already entered Korea and, regardless of clear Chinese statements of intent to intervene, MacArthur clung to his belief until his troops were being driven southwards by the Chinese Peoples Volunteer Army.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          MacArthur fell victim to a form of “confirmation bias,” seizing upon intelligence which confirmed his world view and rejecting that which didn’t. Intelligence which contradicts one’s views is the easiest to reject, but the most important to consider. In business, where there is built-in need to be optimistic about deals and partners, intelligence provides a critical check and balance.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          <b className='article-paragraphs'>Understanding the Intelligence Industry</b>
          <br></br>
          An ecosystem of intelligence firms has grown to support corporate needs. Some are founded by former intelligence professionals; others have evolved out of investigative firms, media conglomerates, or “big box” consultancies. Each brings advantage and disadvantage; there is no one size fits all. To evaluate and choose, ask your potential intelligence partner a few key questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u className='article-paragraphs'>Where are you strong?</u> Whether on an issue or geography, if an intelligence firm claims that they are good at everything, then walk away. Even the CIA and MI6 have coverage gaps; no firm can offer universally strong intelligence coverage across the array of locations and problems your firm faces.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u className='article-paragraphs'>What are your sources?</u> You want to understand how and where the firm collects its raw intelligence. They probably won’t tell you source names, but they should be able to describe the types of positions, nature of their relationships, and reporting track records. You should be confident that the access matches requirements.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u className='article-paragraphs'>Who are your analysts?</u> Many firms rely on ranks of young graduates to staff their analytic boiler rooms. While smart and sometimes well trained, they may also be inexperienced and have no direct understanding of the geography or issues on which they write. Find out who is writing the analysis, what experience they have, and what languages are covered. Determine as well whether you will have direct access to them.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u className='article-paragraphs'>Do you subcontract?</u> A number of larger firms simply act as intelligence general contractors, subcontracting your requirements to other local firms, generally not transparent to you. This may result in higher cost and higher risks.
          </li>
          <li className='article-text article-paragraphs'><u className='article-paragraphs'>What are your standards?</u> You should get clear answers to this question which reflects your ethical values and compliance culture. Beware of cowboys, winks and nods, and suggestions that there is a shortcut. You don’t have a get out of jail free card.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Intelligence is there for you, not just for three-letter agencies. It provides advantage in your decision-making, sometimes small, sometimes large. It provides threat warning, but also enables you to conduct business in tough environments and geographies where context is everything. Intelligence taps into the skills, reach and networks of your workforce.
        </p>
        <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
          In short, smart application of basic intelligence principles can enable your organization, however small or large, to understand and adapt to a complex world of dynamically evolving threat and constantly evolving opportunity.

            Russia’s willingness to detain a U.S. citizen in apparent retaliation for the recent case against Russian citizen Marina Butina, should serve as a warning to U.S. citizens who are traveling – without the benefit of diplomatic immunity –  of the risks in traveling to countries where the rule of law is dictated by geopolitical considerations. It’s a risk which current business and personal travelers should be aware of and one that is not likely to go away in the near term.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            While there is never a completely “safe” time to travel to countries like Russia or China, the examples of Whelan, Canadian citizens Michael Spevor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig, both detained in recent weeks by Chinese authorities “on suspicion of endangering national security” should serve as a warning of just how real the risk can be.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            The detention of the Canadians is presumed to be in retaliation for the arrest of Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on December 1, 2018.  Meng was detained by the Canadians for extradition at the request of U.S. authorities. She is a prominent Chinese businesswoman, a senior executive at Huawei, a technology firm already under heavy U.S.-led pressure for suspected collection activity for Chinese intelligence.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            No one should be surprised at China’s rapid retaliatory detention of the Canadians. The timing of Whelan’s detention is certainly not coincidental either and needs to be considered within the context of geopolitical risk in U.S.-Russian relations. At the moment, geopolitical considerations are paramount.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            While no one would argue that Marina Butina is a figure of any consequence beyond her media notoriety, (she is certainly not the equivalent in stature of Meng), in the context of the free fall of U.S.-Russian relations and the abundance of headlines on the malfeasance and missteps of Russian intelligence operatives in recent months, it was only a matter of time before Putin ordered retaliatory measures for her detention.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            Putin, a former intelligence officer, is likely a historian of the genre and knows there is a long history of non-combatants being caught up in spy games. Moreover, he is probably still stinging from the embarrassment of the June 2010 arrest of ten Russian “illegals” in the U.S. and their subsequent ‘spy swap’ for Russians who were arrested under charges of cooperation with western intelligence services.  (One of the illegals was Anna Chapman whose publicity following her arrest has led to a successful career in television and modeling in Russia).  This is not to make light of Whelan’s detention, which is quite serious, nor should we think that Putin is not capable of being disproportionately ruthless in these circumstances. Take for example, the case of the Ukrainian sailors detained in the Russian aggression in the Sea of Azov which resulted in President Trump cancelling his meeting with Putin at the recent G-20 summit in Buenos Aires.  Twenty-one of the twenty-four detained Ukrainian sailors have been transferred to Moscow’s notorious Lefortova Prison. The three wounded sailors are now incarcerated at the hospital wing of the equally notorious Matrosskaya Tishina prison.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            Whelan will likely not face such a fate, at least not in the near term, with sustained media attention.  Though as Congress considers legislation to impose additional sanctions on Russia for the Russian Military Intelligence (GRU) nerve agent attack against former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the UK last year, as well as for meddling in the U.S. mid-term elections, and perhaps even as a reaction to the Mueller investigation (if that leads to allegations of collusion in the near term) the Whelan case could quickly turn into a high-stakes game. Depending on events, don’t be surprised if another U.S. citizen is detained. Putin will have plenty of support for such escalation in the hardline community upon whose support he relies, and the Russian general public who are inundated with state-controlled media propaganda of western conspiracies against Russia.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            In light of the risks highlighted by these recent detentions, what should western business travelers think about if they have planned business or personal travel to countries where the rule of law is trumped by geopolitics?
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            First, consider deferring travel until the geopolitical atmosphere improves.  Second, take steps to minimize your risk by carefully considering what technical equipment you take along with you. What may be considered benign in the West might not be viewed the same way in a hostile environment.  For example, does your computer or smartphone contain information which could be considered incriminating by a hostile regime?  In the case of Russia or China, saved news articles that are critical of the regime and are stored on your computer, or posts from “anti-regime” websites, could be incriminating.  Travelers should also consider email correspondence that they would not want to see in the possession of a hostile prosecutor, all of which could be considered ‘evidence’ of hostile intent. Encrypted correspondence, similarly so.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            Is the purpose of your travel clearly articulated and documented? Is it affiliated with well-known institutions with a long record of travel to your destination?  Has an effort been made to register travel with the appropriate U.S. embassy or consulate?   While on the ground, are you prepared to undertake appropriate precautions to make sure you don’t violate any local laws, engage in illegal currency transactions or participate in the unauthorized purchase of articles of historical or cultural value? These can be common traps for business travelers.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            Taking an unregistered GPS-capable device near a sensitive government facility can be considered an act of espionage in some countries. The location of those facilities may not always be apparent.
          </p>
          <p className='article-text article-paragraphs'>
            Geopolitical issues are a serious factor in international business travel. The days when carrying a U.S. or western passport or being engaged in a developmental business or NGO that provided some form of protection are long gone.  Be the prudent traveler who is aware of the risks and take appropriate actions.
